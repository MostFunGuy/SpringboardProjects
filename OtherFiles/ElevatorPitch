	2: What do you do? 
	3: What are you looking for?


Alan/Whoever else sees this: This is really hard, much harder than the programming. 


1: Who are you?
	My name is Richard Thompson (??? Unsure what to add here. question 2 is also who I am)


2: What do you do?
	I'm a software developer with 11 years of experience in a variety of languages, including C#, cpp and javascript. I have worked with both game development and web development, Unreal Engine and .NET systems for the military. I previously have held a TS/SCI clearance, and have worked both as a federal and state contractor. 


3: What are you looking for/Why are you telling them this?
	After spending some time as a software tester, I'm looking to go back to software development. My time as a software tester helped me grow as a developer, but wasn't a permanent goal. I am seeking a backend developer position where I can continue to learn best practices. (I realize this entire section here sounds a bit off, still working on it)
